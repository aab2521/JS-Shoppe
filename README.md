This is my first project on React JS. JS-Shoppe stands for JavaScript shoppe a go to name for my project.  I used React Js for frontend and for the styling purpose I used material UI the objects displayed on this project are not self coded objects but the are being fetched from my Commerce Js database through API and payment method has been installed through stripe. I tried to use all the recent frameworks available in the industry, from my side in this project. It took me around 9 days to complete this project. this is my hosted link for the site.
